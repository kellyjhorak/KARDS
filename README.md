# About The Project
**Den** is a interactive chrome extension built to help people aged 16-28 achieve a state of regulated emotions before making online purchases so they can reduce their number of impuslive purchases.

Navigate to the **Getting Started** section below to set up Den on your machine.

Our team consists of 5 University of Washington Informatics Undergrads (as part of our Capstone project!)

_Aaron Jones_ - Lead Product Manager

_Dylan Brown_ - Graphic Designer

_Razan Mansour_ - Data Scientist

_Sophia Mangrubang_ - UX Designer

_Kelly Mansour_ - UX Researcher

# Built With
This section includes the major frameworks/languages/technologies we utilized for this project
- React
- Vite
- Node.js
- Javascript
- Firebase
- HTML/CSS

# Getting Started
Our repository includes two major sections, the KARDS repository (which includes all of the current files of our project) and the project-draft folder (which includes the HTML/CSS draft of our project). To get a local copy up and running on your machine, follow these instructions.

### Prereqs
First, clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/kellyjhorak/KARDS.git
```
Next, make sure that you have Node.js installed on your device, then install NPM packages
```
npm install npm@latest -g
npm install firebase
```
### Installation steps
1. After npm installs, run the build in your IDE terminal (under the main repository "KARDS")
```
npm run build
```
2. Then, navigate to your chrome extensions at "chrome://extensions"
3. Next, ensure 'developer mode' is turned on (in the top right), then select "Load unpacked"
4. Finally, select the 'dist' folder located in KARDS/dist. You should see the Den extension load without errors in "All extensions"

# Timeline
Den was developed as part of our INFO 491 Project Capstone, spanning the Winter and Spring quarters of 2025 (January to June 2025).

**Winter Quarter** largely consisted of Market/User Research, Literature Review, Mood Boards, User Personas, User Validation, MVP development, and other work.

**Spring Quarter** consisted of Final Project development, Usability Testing, serveral re-iterations, and other work.

### Next work
Although we are ultimately deciding to close down this project, the next evolution of our product would lie in the mobile space. Going into the project, we understood that to best connect with our user base (people aged 16-28), a mobile app would likely be the most effective product. However, we ended up creating the chrome extension instead as it aligned more closely with our technical skills and simply put, we wanted to create an extension.
